### 🧭 My Journey & Vision

My path is one of deep immersion. I am currently building a robust foundation in **Network Operations (NetOps)** while mastering the intricate art of **Security and Cryptography**.

My vision is to operate at the nexus of these disciplines, leading the evolution of **AI-driven network security (AIOps)** and understanding its strategic impact on business in the modern geopolitical landscape.

I am particularly drawn to the challenge of **decentralized networks and blockchain**, not just as a technology, but as a paradigm for creating fundamentally more resilient and trustless systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently engineering **a Python script to analyze network logs for suspicious patterns**.
- 🌱 I’m deepening my expertise in **public key infrastructure (PKI) and exploring encryption algorithms like AES and RSA**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source security tools and network analysis projects**.
- 🤔 I’m seeking to understand **the practical implementation of Zero Trust architectures**.
- 💬 Ask me about **my journey into cryptography, network protocols, or the future of quantum-resistant cryptography!**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I find clarity in chaos, whether it's in a packet capture or a complex cryptographic problem.**
