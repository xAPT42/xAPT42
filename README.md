### 🧭 My Journey & Vision

Currently in an apprenticeship, I am building a strong foundation in **Network Operations (NetOps)** while diving deep into the fascinating worlds of **Security and Cryptography**.

My ultimate goal is to evolve at the crossroads of these fields, specializing in **AI-driven network security (AIOps)** and understanding its strategic impact on business within the modern geopolitical landscape.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **[e.g., a Python script to analyze network logs for suspicious patterns]**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **the fundamentals of public key infrastructure (PKI) and exploring encryption algorithms like AES and RSA**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source security tools or network analysis projects**.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **understanding the practical implementation of Zero Trust architectures**.
- 💬 Ask me about **my journey into cryptography, the basics of network protocols, or my thoughts on quantum-resistant cryptography!**
- 📫 How to reach me: **[your.email@example.com] or on LinkedIn.**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I think a well-crafted encryption algorithm is as beautiful as a piece of poetry!**
